# Publicly available encrypted DNS resolvers
Collect publicly available encrypted DNS resolvers in a parseable format

I am pretty much interested in publicly available DoH (DNS-over-HTTPS) resolvers. Not many public lists are available, or if there is one, it is cumbersome to use it without tedious manual labour. 
This repository is for collecting DoH (and possible other encrypted DoX resolvers' data, e.g., DoT, DoQ) resolvers data in an easily parseable JSON file. 

# How the data is collected
So far, there is only one credible source I found, which is the Wiki page of cURL. See it [here](https://github.com/curl/curl/wiki/DNS-over-HTTPS). However, it only contains a table of accessible resolvers.
